## Triangle Tracker
### Author:


### Description:
Triangle tracker is a super cool, learning app, with the ability to detect the type of a triangle when a user keys in the values of the three sides of the triangle. (Equilateral, scalene, isosceles or not a triangle.)

It's a really useful app to the junior learners and and a beautiful tool for fun and help you relax the mind.

### Languages used:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS


### BDD:
#### This app is therefore expected to work as following:
* Be able to display an input button for the user.
* Display a submit function for the user
* If the values entered by the user are all equal - The result should be "Equilateral triangle: All sides are equal".
* If the user enters two equal sides - The result should be "Isosceles triangle: Two sides are equal"
* If the user enter values that aren't equal - The result should be "Scalene: No sides are equal"
* And if the values entered by the user are quite unrealistic to make a triangle, the the result will be "Not a triangle"

### Setup requirements:
* Web browser
